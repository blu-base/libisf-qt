 * Changed all the code to use it instead of plain QByteArrays.
 * Completed huffman decompression support.
 * Added algorithm data to help writing gorilla decompression.
 * Added tests for the IsfData class.
 * Added tag recognization.
 * Fixed some IsfData bugs.
 * Changed default CMake build type to debugfull.
 * Completed Gorilla decompression support.
 * Started tag parsing work, made basic analysis methods.

 * Make decode(UInt|Int) take a reference as a position parameter. This
   reference is then incremented as the integer is decoded.
 * Re-work tests for IsfDrawing.
 * Create IsfDrawing::fromIsfData() static method to create a new IsfDrawing
   instance from a QByteArray containing ISF data.
 * Begin state matchine for ISF parser.
 * Add appropriate unit tests for ISF parser.
 * Added TODO file for libisf to keep track of things.

 * Parse ISF version number properly; add unit tests for it.
 * Fix CMakeLists.txt to build with debug info by default
 * Moved format/types.(cpp|h) into the multibytecoding.(cpp|h) classes.
   Also moved these into libisf/ and deleted format/ directory.
 * Added Isf::encodeInt to encode a signed integer into multibyte format
 * Added test cases for the encode/decode functions.
 * Re-add libisf.h
 * Fix wrong e-mail addresses in copyright info.
 * Created a unit test framework for libisf-qt; run using make test
 * Created IsfDrawing class which will represent an ISF drawing.
 * Added some rudimentary unit tests for IsfDrawing
