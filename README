About LibISF:
============

LibISF is a Qt4 library made to encode and decode Microsoft's
Ink Serialized Format.

Q. What the hell is this?
A. It's going to be (hopefully) a Qt rewrite of aMSN's ISF
   encoding/decoding library, on which code we are building.

Q. How will this library differ from aMSN's?
A. It's being written with Qt, which makes it easily portable on
   a lot of different architectures; also Qt's new licensing
   terms (LGPL) will make it possible for everyone to use it
   easily. Moreover, aMSN's is not distributed by itself, ours
   is.

Q. Are you aware it'll be a lot of work?
A. Hell yeah. It's time to seminate a bit farther than our usual
   little field!



Compiling and installing:
=================

LibISF uses CMake, a quick and clean alternative to Autotools.

First create a new directory within the one which contains this
file (we'll have the library built there):
$ mkdir build
Enter it and run CMake:
$ cd build
$ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
Then, if everything went smoothly, build the library itself:
$ make
If everything went right again, install it:
$ make install
Aaand now you're set. :)



Documentation:
=================

The ISF format is well documented: here's the sources we use.

- Original Microsoft ISF specification, made open with their Open Specification Promise:
