About LibISF-Qt:
============

LibISF-Qt is a Qt4 library made to encode and decode Microsoft's
Ink Serialized Format (ISF) files.

Q. What the hell is this?
A. It's a library, written in C++/Qt4, to read and write ISF
   image files.

Q. How does this library differ from aMSN's or Emesene's?
A. It's written with Qt, which makes it easily portable on
   a lot of different architectures; also Qt's new licensing
   terms (LGPL) make it possible for everyone to use it
   easily.
   The library supports more ISF features than those two,
   since we've written it using the official specification.
   Moreover, aMSN's and Emesene's are not distributed by
   theirselves, ours is.

Q. What's the status of completion of the library, and which
   ISF features does/will support?
A. Please see the TODO file to have an overview.



Compiling and installing:
=================

LibISF-Qt uses CMake, a quick and clean alternative to Autotools.

First create a new directory within the one which contains this
file (we'll have the library built there):
$ mkdir build
Enter it and run CMake:
$ cd build
$ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
Then, if everything went smoothly, build the library itself:
$ make
If everything went right again, install it:
$ make install
Aaand now you're set. :)

LibISF-Qt natively supports being bundled into other applications.
Bundling means that the library does not get installed system-wide
along with your application, but instead it gets statically linked
into the application.
The idea is that you copy the Isf-Qt source tree (with an SVN export
or a Git submodule) into your project's tree, and then set up your
CMake listfile to add this library as a subdirectory:
> SET( ISFQT_IS_BUNDLED TRUE )
> ADD_SUBDIRECTORY( contrib/isf-qt )
And again, you're done!


Documentation:
=================

The ISF format is (albeit poorly*) documented: here's the
sources we used.

- Original Microsoft ISF specification, made open with their
  Open Specification Promise:
  http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/B/E/0BE8BDD7-E5E8-422A-ABFD-4342ED7AD886/InkSerializedFormat(ISF)Specification.pdf
- Quick explanation of the algorithms and other very useful
  details:
  http://synce.org/moin/FormatDocumentation/InkSerializedFormat
- Original code from aMSN:
  https://amsn.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/amsn/trunk/amsn/utils/tclISF/src
- Original code from emesene:
  https://emesene.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/emesene/trunk/emesene/pyisf

* = The specification was probably not meant for use by
    developers wanting to write an alternative implementation;
    there's a lot of guesswork to be done.
